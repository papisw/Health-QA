of course+ i know my liver is not going to put up with this habit in the long run+ but how long does someone like me have in their current situation? ,how long doe it take to get a physical addiction to alcohol as in going through a dt situation?,it doesnt take long to get addicted to alcohol .. it all starts with the first drink getting the dts can happen to anyone regardless of how long they have been drinking on a regular basis going through dts can start anywhere from 6 to 48 hours after a person stops drinking they can last from a few hours up to weeks at a time can and are very severe a person hallucinates+ can lead to convulsions+ seizures not a good thing -- more to dts than that and can get very serious however most likely when you stop drinking after the binge you go on that happens because you are going through withdrawal which also come along with the craving for more the body is telling the drinker they need more alcohol it is uncomfortable...get nauseaus+ hot and cold sweats+ shakes etc. so when a person is going through that they take a drink thinking it will ease the withdrawls-- and then it starts all over again..get drunk..withdraw..drink..get drunk if and when a person gets through them ..stops drinking for a while.. like till the weekend...maybe then sooner or later forgets what they went through and drinks again viscious circle,1
of course+ i know my liver is not going to put up with this habit in the long run+ but how long does someone like me have in their current situation? ,how long doe it take to get a physical addiction to alcohol as in going through a dt situation?,ive been drinking on and off for many years...ive never had the dts but i think ive been close. i just went on the wagon a couple of months ago+ but it was for financial reasons. when i drink i like to start early in the day+ even early morning and stay drunk all day and into the night...then when i wake up the next day i am sick as hell so i start drinking all over again+ this will go on for at least three days and that translates into roughly 75-100 bucks. i was doing this once a week. and im thinking of trying to have just a few drinks this weekend to see if i can do it without going nutso on the ****.0,0
of course+ i know my liver is not going to put up with this habit in the long run+ but how long does someone like me have in their current situation? ,alcohol and the liver. 1 bottle of wine a night+ how long before liver failure?,no one can answer this question with any accuracy including a liver specialist since liver failure due to alcohol abuse varies so much from one person to another. there are people who might have cirrhosis from this in 10 years while someone else could take 20-30 years. cirrhosis occurs when healthy tissue is replaced with scar tissue in the liver not allowing it to function as it should. its a very slow disease that can take a very long time depending on many factors such as what you drink+ alcohol content+ when you drink+ genetics+ medical history+ any underlying medical problems+ how well your body handles alcohol+ size+ etc. age really has little to do with it. how much and how long the person has been drinking is the most important but many other factors come into play also. there is no way to tell how long it will take and this is coming from a nurse who had liver failure and a transplant (not from alcohol abuse).,1
of course+ i know my liver is not going to put up with this habit in the long run+ but how long does someone like me have in their current situation? ,alcohol and the liver. 1 bottle of wine a night+ how long before liver failure?,the only answers i want to hear are from medical professionals or people who actually know the answer. if a person drinks a bottle of wine every night how long will it be before their liver fails or they die from something else. if the person is about 50 years old0,1

i dont know how long he has left i dont know what his livers like and hes really worrying me.,i pierced my left ear. i dont know how long i need to alcohol it or anything really?,you need to keep that stud in for a minimum of 6 to 8 weeks. ideally much longer say 6 months. to clean it you should soak it in sea salt. mixing    teaspoon of non-iodized sea salt mixed into 8 ounces of clean water (4 teaspoons salt into 1 gallon water) creates an approximately 0.9% saline solution. piercings are submerged and soaked for 5 minutes or so and then rinsed quickly with clean water or sterile saline and patted dry with paper towels or gauze. this is usually done 2-4 times per day. some piercers suggest soaking prior to showers and others suggest soaking following showers. the link below might be useful to you. http://community.tribalectic.com/article   ,0

i dont know how long he has left i dont know what his livers like and hes really worrying me.,so how long does it take to start really doing you liver damage and also to become an alcoholic?,the book is right. it takes 10-30 years in which a lot of factors come into play in calculating that time frame. it can vary quite a bit from one person to another. i have even seen people get it in less than 10 years but it is not all that common. i really dont know if you are an alcoholic or not+ but i dont think you should rule it out. the term alcoholic has so many different meanings+ but anyone that drinks as much as you do really does have a drinking problem in my opinion. you are drinking way over what is safe to drink on a daily basis and certainly enough to get you drunk. you might think you are not drunk+ but that goes along with problem drinking too and alcoholism. they think they are fine. you certainly cannot rule it out because you have a single night of not being drunk or even a week of not drinking. you are definitely drinking enough to cause liver failure which takes a long time+ but you could be damaging your liver more and more each day you abuse alcohol. that one day off is going to do nothing to heal the liver with 6 days of heavy drinking on each end of it. that is really nothing when it comes to the liver recuperating from the onslaught of a toxin. it can handle toxins in normal amounts+ but you are way over and the liver will start to suffer. if you are not an alcoholic+ then the smart thing to do is to drink the amount that doctors say is safe. if you cannot do that+ then you should revisit the possibility that you cannot quit drinking and do indeed have a problem. the doctors say one glass of wine for a woman and two for men on a daily basis is ok+ but not more than that. you are drinking almost 10 times that much every day. not good. not healthy. not smart. if you really want ot know if you are an alcoholic+ stop drinking all alcohol for a few months and see if you can remain sober for an extended period of time. if not+ then you have a problem. hope everything works out for you.,1

why isnt alcohol illegal like marijuana?,why is alcohol legal but marijuana illegal?,your argument is actually illogical. you are arguing backwards. it is like we learned in kindergarten+ 2 wrongs dont make a right. drunk people are problematic for sure. so why would we want to add stoned people to the mix as well? im not saying that it should or shouldnt be legal...im just saying your argument doesnt stand. and a stoned driver isnt necessarily safer than a drunk driver. they are both very dangerous.,1
why isnt alcohol illegal like marijuana?,why is alcohol legal but marijuana illegal?,they actually at one time+ several decades ago+ tried to make alcohol illegal but it caused several issues such as mob wars so they felt it was safer to keep it legal. in other words it was the    prohibition era.    the best driver is most often a sober driver but thats not always safe. but yes when compairing alcohol and pot+ a stoned driver is more aware and much safer than a drunk driver. mainly because alcohol makes a person unfocused while marijuana makes a person over-focused. alcohol impairs judgment+ while a stoned driver is still fully capable of making rational decisions. just because a stoned driver has an accident doesnt mean its because of marijuana. that just gives people an excuse to blame marijuana.1,1

my father has been an alcoholic all his life so what can i do to help?,my father is an alcoholic+ i dont know what to do anymore?,sorry i can understand how terrible things were at home for you. alcoholism is a disease and needs treatment. but it works faster if the patient cooperates. you are not with your parents that is really good and that gives you opportunity to help them more from outside. think of your mom+ she must get some help too. if possible take your dad to a de-addiction centre and let the doctor treat him. you can take help of police if your father is unwilling to go to a doc. as he is beating your mom+ that is reason enough to report him+ violence against women (domestic violence) is a recognised crime. so that will make ways to take your dad to hospital or de-addiction centre. the link below tells about steps children can follow to deal with alcoholic and abusive parents: http://www.wikihow.com/deal-with-an-alco    but this is more for those who are staying with the parents+ you are now out of parents place the link below is a support group+ check out+ you may get necessary info: http://www.smartrecovery.org/?gclid=cn6c    best of luck,1

how much of a role does drug & alcohol abuse by parents play in developing addiction in children?,how much worse is hepatitis c when there is existing liver damage from alcoholism and drug abuse?,you mentioned three of about 40 causes of liver cell damage: alcohol consumption+ medication toxification+ and viral infection. when the liver cell become damaged from any cause+ the immune system of the body will respond to this and cause inflammation to develop inside the liver which causes the liver to enlarge in size and take on a spongy texture. hepatitis c is a virus that has entered the body and is using the liver cells to replicate itself. when it uses that cell+ it dies and the virus will move to the next. the doctor can tell by blood testing+ how much virus is in the liver... which is known as viral load. some people can live many years with this viral infection or they can advance alot quicker. if the alcohol and drug abuse is totally stopped and she is detoxed from it...then there may be a chance she will have a longer life<semcol> as long as it hasnt progressed to the next point: if the causes cannot be stopped+ then the liver cells die off and form scar tissue inside the liver. this scar tissue (fibrosis)will continue to develop as more cells die off+ and will start to connect (bridging fibrosis). the scars change the structure of the liver inside and blood will have difficulty flowing through the liver to the cells... this is cirrhosis. it is not reversible+ but a progressive disease. now to answer your question directly: only the doctors can tell by doing a liver biopsy+ how far advanced in this disease she may be. they will also be checking her blood lab tests continuously. transplant centers usually require a patient to be detoxed from drugs/alcohol for a period of six months prior to being referred to them for the evaluation process of being placed on the transplant list. however+ if she overcomes this...they do transplant patient with hepatitis c virus. this is the most anyone here would be able to tell you. best wishes,0
how much of a role does drug & alcohol abuse by parents play in developing addiction in children?,how much worse is hepatitis c when there is existing liver damage from alcoholism and drug abuse?,having hep c and being an alcoholic is really a double whammy to the liver. these people usually progress to total liver failure much quicker than someone just being an alcoholic alone or just having hep c alone. a lot depends on how much of a viral load is attacking the liver and only a doctor can give testing to find that out. she would need a liver biopsy and routine blood work to figure out how much damage she has and whether or not it is progressing and how fast. if she is not experiencing any signs of liver failure yet+ then that would be quite amazing after 30 years. no one probably really knows when she got hep c exactly+ but if she was diagnosed with it 30 years ago+ then we know she has had it for the entire time. i would think this person would have serious liver failure issues myself+ but who knows. stranger things have happened. not everyone with hep c will die from it. about 80% of people who have hep c develop a chronic case of it. maybe your friend could be one of the lucky ones that it cleared on its own. i might add that many people who have it have no symptoms of a liver problem for 30 years+ so there may come a time when your friend does start to get symptoms. once symptoms show up+ it means the disease is far advanced and cirrhosis has formed. if your friend does develop cirrhosis and needs a transplant someday+ if she no longer drinks+ then she might qualify to receive a transplant and get well again even though the hep c often times also attacks the new liver that is transplanted. they do give transplants to people who have hep c and also alcoholics in certain circumstances with a total change of lifestyle being the first requirement and absolutely no alcohol or drugs ever for the rest of your life.im a nurse who had cirrhosis of the liver from an autoimmune disease and received a liver transplant.0,0

which type of alcohol would be the best for me?,which beer or alcohol taste best?,"if you like chocolate i would suggest the following beers... youngs double chocolate stout - this beer actually does have a small amount of dark chocolate added when they brew the beer. it wont taste like a chocolate candy bar but you will taste the chocolate malts. yeah+ they call \double\"" because it has chocolate added and chocolate barley malts. you see+ they press the barley for its sugar contents and it gives the beer a chocolatey taste. i do strongly recommend the canned version though because it has a nitrogen widget that ignites when you open the beer. the bottle version doesnt have this. the widget just gives the beer a very creamy texture to it. some people might think this beer would have a lot of calories but it has about the same amount as a regular budweiser+ which is about 150 calories+ but it tastes 100x better than bud. picture - http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_thkgbpd59uc/tk    all the creaminess you see in this picture is from the nitrogen+ it will fade after a few minutes. this is a high quality beer+ pour into glass+ enjoy the view+ see what the aroma is like+ then drink it+ do not drink this right out of the can! i would also recommend a quadruple and a porter. these two beer styles will also have a sweet taste. for a quadruple i would recommend a beer called the reverend by the avery brewing company. tons of dark fruit flavors in this one.... like raisons+ dates+ figs+ cherries and more. however+ it is a very high alcohol beer (10% abv)+ so drink slowly. the sweet taste can fool you. this is also a good beer to age. like a fine wine it will get better with age. i would say+ buy two bottles+ drink one that is fresh then age the other one. i would say age it for about 1 year. recommended aging temperature is 50-55 degrees. keep bottle up-right though+ dont tilt the bottle. again+ quality beer here... dont drink right out of bottle... picture - http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rn1df_pv3se/td    i would also recommend 2 porters+ the first one is black butte porter by the deschuttes brewing company and founders porter+ by the founders brewing company. these beers will have a chocolate and coffee flavor. they will taste kind of like a mocha. have you ever tried a mocha? picture - http://legalbeer.com/images/deschutes%20    http://i.imgur.com/ecf4e.jpg?1 anyhow+ its the type of barley malts they use that gives the beer a coffee like flavor. however+ neither of these beers have chocolate added to them like youngs dcs does. they just put a lot of chocolate malts into these beers. for liquor+ it is almost impossible to suggest something that doesnt taste bitter. but i would highly recommend cognac for your first try. sure+ it will have a bitter alcohol taste but it wont be as intense as some of the other types of alcohol and you will actually be able to taste some other flavors too. cognac and brandy are distilled wines. i would suggest couvoisier vs. its a good first cognac. picture - http://thg-shpk.com/kosovo/sites/default    flavored alcohol might be a better option for your first time+ you should try peppermint schnapps or fireball cinnamon whiskey. they are very sweet. anyhow.. good luck...1""",1

if i quit drinking for a month and then begin to only have a few beers when im at the bars+ will i experience withdrawals after a night of five to six beers?,how do you quit drinking alcohol when all you ever do seems much nicer when you drunk?,i somewhat know what you mean. im so addicted to caffeine that ive actually quit for over one year but found that i was no longer able to produce my own adrenaline without it. also+ my world seems so much happier+ upbeat and almost everything seems easier to deal with when i have at least 2 cups of coffee per day. in the end+ i know ill probably suffer a heart attack or something by the time im 50 because of my addiction+ but i can live with that because i feel the alternative would be more risky. you never know how essential adrenaline is for survival until its not there anymore. plus+ id rather die happy but soon rather than live a long but unhappy life. thats how i choose to live. if you have any doubt at any time that youre happier and more functional with alcohol than it ever was and ever could be without it+ then maybe you should quit just to find out for sure. the first thing to get out of the way is any uncertainty you have about how your addiction affects you+ your job and people in your life. the only way you can be 100% honest with yourself is if you quit for long enough that the cravings go away. then you need to take some more time to seriously evaluate the situation. if you find that alcohol didnt help you substantially more than it hurt you+ then you should probably stay away from it. if you drove away friends or family or lost your job because of your attitude+ actions or words+ then you should definitely stay away from alcohol. no doctor will tell you this+ but you have a right to be happy if youre not hurting anyone. i know from experience that addictions arent always bad as long as youre honest with yourself and can truly tell the difference. the mind can play tricks on you and its important not to be tricked. it really is up to you though+ and i hope you get to the bottom of this. i know thats not advice that will get me any thumbs up+ but its my honest answer and its what i know to be true. i hope this helps you.,0

cirrhosis of the liver caused by alcohol...?,signs of liver failure because your an alcoholic?,"it is quite common for swelling in the belly to occur when liver failure is pretty severe. for an alcoholic+ it most likely means they have cirrhosis which is end stage liver disease. lots of fluid accumulates in the abdomen. your someone needs to see a doctor asap. if they have any trouble breathing or are quite uncomfortable+ then they should definitely go to the hospital to get \tapped\"" or get drained of the fluid. the doctor can give water pills to help that+ but for anyone with cirrhosis+ it is usually a problem that only gets worse over time. there is no cure for cirrhosis other than a liver transplant. i have an autoimmune disease that caused my cirrhosis and liver failure. the swelling you describe is the very first thing that tipped me off that i had something wrong. i found out that my liver was already 90% destroyed with only 10% function left. i had to get a transplant to stay alive. another sign you should look for is fatigue+ and yellow skin and yellow whites of eyes. thats jaundice caused by high biliruben levels. also easy bruising and blood not clotting well when they bleed is a sign. they can also have internal bleeding at any time due to unwanted veins that form called varices that can be weak+ leak+ burst+ and bleed. any kind of bleeding should be considered a crisis and should be taken to the hospital. confusion and behavior changes can be due to high ammonia levels which is also a sign of cirrhosis. if this someone continues to drink+ it will make total liver failure come much quicker which is fatal. they could be in serious trouble. this is often times the sad results of long term alcohol abuse. it does kill people all the time.""",1

cirrhosis of the liver caused by alcohol...?,my dad has liver disease caused by alcohol abuse+ he gets better then worse is this normal?,your father needs to have some testing done such as a ct scan or ultrasound to find out if he has liver damage. a biopsy is the best test possible to really show what is going on and the amount of damage present. your dad could have cirrhosis which occurs when scar tissue replaces healthy tissue in the liver. your fathers long term alcoholism can cause this to happen over many years of drinking which caused active inflammation in the liver which can eventually lead to cirrhosis over time. he is showing some signs of liver failure. by the time physical symptoms of liver failure show up+ the disease is usually already far advanced. a person with cirrhosis can have good and bad days. his days of sleeping and slurred speech if it is not from his drinking could be due to having high ammonia levels if his liver is not working right. this is common in people who have cirrhosis. it can make them feel just blah. they can become confused+ have memory loss+ behavior problems+ etc. high ammonia levels cause a condition called encephalopathy. he needs his ammonia levels checked which can be done with a simple blood draw. his ups and downs could also be caused by his drinking off and on. when he drinks it will have an effect on an already damaged liver since its a toxin which could make his symptoms worsen. then if he quits for awhile+ there might be an improvement. one thing is for certain which is that if he continues to drink+ it will definitely be his death sentence. if he is in the advanced stage of liver failure+ then it will progress to total failure over time no matter what he does to stop it. all drinking will do at that point is make death come faster. this is often times the sad end to long term alcoholism. alcoholics can get liver transplants in some circumstances but there are extra requirements for them in order to get one and its a difficult and hard road to getting one. the first requirement is 6 months of detox (sobriety) before they will even begin to consider them for one. if your father is not interested in changing his lifestyle completely+ there is no hope of him ever getting a transplant. they dont accept someone cutting down on drinking or missing a few days. the person must understand that they have to be sober all the time and will never be able to drink alcohol again for the rest of their life.,1

which is worse+ alcoholism or conservatism?,which is worse+ alcohol vs weed?,id say alcohol is worse+ not weed. i dont smoke it myself but i have known many people that do and ive known many alcoholics+ alcoholics that turn evil when drunk. who sexually abused+ verbally abused and physically. ive lost friends to drink related deaths. ive seen people die of liver cancer ive seen many many fights and voilence and sexual assaults happen under the influence of alcohol. the weed people ive known - ive never ever met a person who turns into a physically abusive person when under the influence of weed. ive known people who are really smart that smoke weed and i mean really smart+ and wow they could have mind blowing conversations. kept jobs down+ were really creative. ok so ive known people that have been dumb who smoke weed but theyve always been dumb not because of the weed. and here is a connection i have made people that end up mentally ill who smoke weed have all had traumatic pasts+ where they have witnessed and been through some horrific things+ which i believe to be the cause of their mental health problem not the weed. because the ones ive known who smoke it and had really good childhoods and things arent affected mentally by smoking weed in any way. so i dont think weed causes mental illness. the reason there is a link is because people who have been through more in their life are more likely to become addicted to a substance+ and because they dont bother getting their heads sorted and just try and block it all out by drugs their mental health worsens but not due to the drug but because they dont bother going and getting therapy or councelling they just try block it out. and also like you say i dont think people who smoke weed are paranoid. and like you said i think alot of them have common sense in not believing everything the media tells them and for being suspicious about things. they think the governments not on their side+ ooh they must be a paranoid lunatic then lol. sorry this isnt exactly research but this is from evaluating people i know. i dont drink or smoke weed. but yea alcohol is worse than weed in my opinion. must be all that flouride they are ingesting+ its doing the job of dumbing them down. everyone is so gullibly controlled by a television+ im glad im not. people just dont like to admit that everything has negative side effects and consequences. they like to pick on one thing to justify the things they like doing. well thats what its seems like.,0

conclusion for my speech about alcohol?,is it ok for me to drink alcohol?,"here this is what i research: doctors and pharmacists are constantly warning patients with epilepsy about the effects of alcohol. if you have epilepsy+ alcohol consumption can have serious consequences. although moderate alcohol consumption is not associated with increased seizure activity+ binge drinking and alcohol withdrawal can cause seizures and even status epilepticus+ a serious and potentially fatal condition. most people with epilepsy are told to abstain from alcohol+ and they are less likely than the general population to use or abuse alcohol. in small amounts+ alcohol does not cause seizures. a drink or two now and then does not increase seizure activity. nor does it alter the amounts of seizure medicines in your blood or change findings on eeg studies. when alcohol is related to seizures+ it has been found that it is nearly always the state of alcohol withdrawal that aggravates seizures+ rather than drinking itself. your risk of seizures may be much higher after consuming three or more alcoholic beverages. these alcohol withdrawal seizures may begin between 6 and 72 hours after you stop drinking. studies suggest that alcohol withdrawal seizures most often occur 7 or 8 hours after heavy or prolonged drinking has stopped. seizure medicines can seriously lower your tolerance for alcohol+ so the immediate effects of alcohol consumption are greater. the rate of intoxication is far higher among people taking seizure medicines. rapid intoxication is extremely problematic because many of the side effects of these medicines+ which can be made worse by alcohol+ are similar to the acute effects of alcohol itself. if you are sensitive to the adverse effects of alcohol or seizure medicines+ you may find the combination especially troublesome. for example+ the side effects of tegretol (carbamazepine)+ including dizziness+ drowsiness+ and headache+ could be enhanced by alcohol. combining those effects with the adverse effects of alcohol+ including slurred speech+ unsteadiness+ dizziness+ and fatigue+ can be extremely dangerous. alcoholism+ or chronic abuse of alcohol+ has been shown in recent studies to be associated with the development of epilepsy in some people. these experiments suggest that repeated alcohol withdrawal seizures may make the brain more excitable. thus+ people who have experienced seizures provoked by binge drinking may begin to experience unprovoked epileptic seizures (\alcoholic epilepsy\"") regardless of alcohol consumption. what effect does alcohol have on seizures? in small to moderate amounts+ alcohol actually has properties to counteract seizures+ but it should never be consumed in the hope of controlling seizures. alcohol does not often provoke seizures while the person is drinking but it may cause \""withdrawal\"" seizures 6 to 72 hours later+ after drinking has stopped. withdrawal seizures are most common among persons who have abused alcohol for years. when alcohol consumption is stopped suddenly or is markedly reduced over a short period of time+ a seizure may occur. this is an example of provoked seizures rather than true epilepsy. long-standing alcohol abuse can increase a persons risk of developing epilepsy. many persons with epilepsy are at a markedly increased risk of seizures after consuming three or more alcoholic beverages. research indicates that adults with epilepsy may have one or two alcoholic beverages a day without any worsening of their seizures or changes in the blood levels of their antiepileptic medications. moderate to heavy alcohol consumption is never recommended for persons with epilepsy. alcohol and some antiepileptic drugs share similar adverse effects. as a result+ persons who are sensitive to the adverse effects of alcohol or antiepileptic drugs may find the combination especially troublesome and extremely dangerous when driving. there :)""",0

weed vs alcohol which do you prefer?,which type of alcohol would be the best for me?,effects of teenage drinking the effects of teenage drinking can be quite serious. fortunately+ teenage alcohol use is on the decline. still+ it is a problem of note+ with three out of four high school students reporting that they have consumed an alcoholic beverage prior to graduating high school. the most serious effects of teenage drinking is that it leads to adult dependence. the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism reports that teens who start drinking before the age of 15 are four times more likely to develop an alcohol addiction than those who do not begin drinking before the legal age of 21. drinking and driving is another danger of teenage alcohol use. forty percent of all alcohol-related fatal car crashes involve teens. teens may not realize they are too impaired to drive+ or they may be afraid to call home for a ride. regardless of the reason+ teens that drink often drive while under the influence. other effects of teenage drinking include decreased inhibitions that may lead to risk-taking behaviors. alcohol intoxication impairs the judgment and teens who are intoxicated may engage in a number of dangerous behaviors. alcohol may also serve as a    gateway drug    into more serious drug use. once teens have decided alcohol use is acceptable+ they may feel other drugs are also okay. impaired judgment may also lead to the experimentation with other drugs. teen alcohol use nearly always causes poor performance in school+ if the teen is using on any kind of a regular basis. teens who use alcohol have trouble concentrating in class and on assignments. they also have difficulty with peer relationships and with relationships with teachers and other authority figures. teen alcohol use also causes family problems. teens who use alcohol may withdraw from the family and have difficulty with family relationships. they may demonstrate behavioural problems as well. there are also health risks involved with alcohol use. people today are well aware of the health problems caused by excessive alcohol consumption. health problems can include stomach ulcers+ liver problems+ heart problems+ and malnutrition. these problems generally occur in people who have been drinking over a longer period of time and are not always seen in teens+ but can result as they grow older if they continue to drink. finally+ teens who use alcohol may have legal problems due to their behavior. underage drinking is illegal+ and teens who drink may engage in other illegal behaviours as well. the effects of teenage drinking is a problem that worries parents+ educators+ and policy makers alike. it is a far-reaching problem and affects us all directly and/or indirectly. preventing teenage alcohol use fortunately+ there are things that can be done to decrease teenage alcohol use. by simply talking to their teenagers about the use of alcohol and the effects of teenage drinking+ parents can reduce the risk of their children drinking. studies show that teens whose parents talk to them about alcohol and drugs are 42% less likely to use those substances than teens whose parents don   t discuss the issue with them. parents can also help by setting good examples for their teens. if they drink+ parents should do so responsibly+ and never drive while under the influence. most schools also provide educational programs designed to educate students about the dangers of underage drinking. some of these programs are more effective than others. one popular program+ dare+ involves local police officers coming into the schools to talk to students about drugs and alcohol. its effectiveness has been called into question+ but it is still one of the most widely used programs today.,0

weed vs alcohol which do you prefer?,drugs or alcohol which is worse!!!?,in the 1920s+ the american government attempted to place a ban on alcohol. this act+ called the prohibition act+ had surprising negative affects on society. definitely do some research on this period to get information supporting your argument. finding medical reasons why it should be legal might be harder+ as the effects of alcohol abuse can be worse than that of even abuse of contraband drugs. perhaps you could mention that controlled alcohol intake can have a surprisingly positive effect on the brain due to the fact that it kills inert brain cells+ which your body will replace with faster ones. alcohol abuse is one of the few addictions that can be a direct cause of death. if an addict does not get a constant intake of alcohol they could potentially die. perhaps this could be a blessing in disguise for your argument. if your country were to place a complete ban on alcohol it would effectively result in a death sentence for those currently addicted.,0

i also would like to know how to go about putting her on suicide watch. ,i have to do an essay about drugs and alcohol and how todays teens are familiar with the facts and dangers?,drug abuse among teens is spreading rapidly across illinois. drug addiction is considered a disease+ and it is in fact spreading like a virus among our children. in this essay+ we will try to explain why the drug abuse problem is so serious. by drugs+ we mean all the substances that have negative effects+ especially on child   s health+ including cigarettes and alcohol+ beside over the counter drugs+ prescription and illicit (street) drugs. although not all of them has the same harmful effect+ to a teenager any abuse of non-healthy substances can result in a serious development problems. teen drug abuse is habitual misuse of substances+ in order to alter teen   s emotion+ mood and state of consciousness. most teens from illinois+ who develop habit of drug abusing+ eventually develop dependence+ too. it is hard to resist dependence when teens use drugs on regular bases+ as almost every one of them has addicting attributes. drug addiction is even more dangerous than occasional use of drugs+ of course. when a teen becomes an addict+ almost nothing else matters to him+ but his daily dose. some of them even develop hard dependence that even one dose per day is not enough. when teens want to get high+ they don   t waver much and will use whatever they can. if they don   t have something stronger+ many of them will empty your medicine cabinet or go and buy some legal drug that will alter their psychic for a little bit. in fact+ many illinois teens actually start by abusing prescription drugs+ until they get bored with them and decide to switch to illegal drugs. teens that abuse any kind of drugs neglect everything else. from their love relationships and friends+ family and house works+ to school and other activities. sadly+ many even give up on sports and/or schoolwork and fail classes+ as they find new joy in life. what seems to be a solution for their teen problems actually brings them more trouble+ which can follow them through the rest of their life. many teens who start with drugs+ never give it up+ if they don   t have the proper support from parents and don   t get treatment on time. even if they don   t continue abusing illicit drugs+ there is a great chance they will be alcoholics or smokers. teen drug abuse results in unsecured grown-ups+ both socially and economically+ and brings health troubles to many people. drug abuse and dependence costs money+ so many teens are in constant need of it. they are forced to borrow money often+ or lie to their parents why do they need it. later+ especially if they drop out school+ they may turn to be unemployed+ but still in need of drugs+ so they turn to dealing drugs or other criminal activities.biggest problems teen drug abusers get into are health troubles+ of course. drugs can affect every body part+ especially lungs+ liver+ heart and brain. many heart attacks and death of teens occur because of the often drug abuse or over dose. overdose happens when teens take more quantity of drugs than what they used to or sometimes when they stumble to pure substance. we hope that this essay helped you think a little more about this destructive problem many teens and parents deal with+ and that you will pay more attention to your teen   s behavior and attitude about drugs. data from illinois clearly say that more parent have to involve in the drug abuse prevention+ for the sake of their children.,0

(ive been both an alcoholic and a heroin addict so i know that im right to say that alcohol is the one which ruins your health and twists your mind). you say that she says she drinks because life is so awful+ i used to do the same. it took years for me to realise that life seemed awful because i drank+ rather than me drinking because life itself was at fault. long term drinking causes depression and therefore makes life seem awful+ drinking gives temporary relief but then the depression returns worse than before. as they say+ what goes up has to come down+ this is very true of alcohol. if she manages to stop drinking then after a while her depression will either be much less or disappear altogether+ making her happier and therefore feeling that she doesnt need to hide behind the drink. she would also become much more healthy+ something else which would cheer her up. alcohol is the cause of her depression+ its not curing it but is in fact creating it and making it worse. of course though its difficult to see this when youre in that situation. also+ the health warnings that we get about alcohol always emphasise the physical risks+ they never mention that its a strong depressant which can induce suicidal tendencies if abused in the long term. if it was heroin that she was on then she would be much more functional+ not only that but heroin use tends to make drinking alcohol feel repulsive and unneccesary. when i started on the heroin that was the end of my drinking. it might not be the normal thing to do but i deliberately started on it because i knew how it changed my feelings about alcohol+ nothing else was ever going to break through my alcoholism so i concluded it was better to be an alive junkie than a dead alcoholic. of course though getting off heroin was a battle too but now im free of addiction to either and lead a normal life. alls well that ends well i suppose. im not advocating that she does the same+ this is just how i approached the situation. it would also be a bad idea for her to get into that if she still has her ex addict boyfriend because hed soon end up back on it too.,0

how long does it take for the alcohol to leave my body?,how long does it take for alcohol to damage your body?,starts the damage at the first drink. we have a small amount of alcohol in our bodies naturally. once you begin to add external alcohol our organs go into overdrive trying to return our bodies chemistry to normal. the brain+ liver+ kidneys and heart begin to work overtime. just like a machine+ the more you use it the faster it wears out. brain cells begin to die within minutes and the chemistry of our brain slows the reproduction of new cells. the more drinks you have the more used to a higher level of alcohol our bodies become. that is why we have alcoholism. it really starts with the first drink. people often say that the best way to get over a hangover is to drink more. that right there shows you how quickly the alcoholism sets in. i have seen many young people having drinks in the morning to clear their hangover but that just returns the alcohol level in the body to an abnormal level. our country is not covered with rehab centers for nothing. the part of the brain that is most damaged is the part that helps us reason. many alcoholics have great emotional problems like a child. they cannot deal with much in an adult fashion and when life throws a challenge to them they reach for the bottle first to forget. but when they sober off their problems are still there. the most immature adults i have ever known are alcoholics. they cannot deal with anything on a realistic level. my own 49 year old brother still behaves like a 12-year old when he doesnt get his way<semcol> he has a serious alcohol issue. it seems to run in families. i am not sure how i got so lucky but i think it is because i value education so much. i realized early on that i needed to give up the alcohol and pot if i wanted to grow up and be somebody. drugs and alcohol are for people who do not have the intellectual ability to be a great person. although it is true that many great people also become alcoholics+ their drinking or pot smoking usually did not start until after they went to college. but no matter what age you begin+ alcohol can quickly destroy your life.,0

alcohol and why it makes you so happy?,why does alcohol make me cry?,acohol is a mood depressant - it inhibits higher brain functions first+ so can reduce social anxiety+ but eventually (and especially if you are prone to poor mood) it will cause loss of more aspects of control... this can lead to more drinking and a spiral of low mood bolstered by temporary loss of self and then depression. id strongly recommend deciding what you will drink before hand and *not* exceeding this (and to keep the limit either very low (a cider or a beer+ or one glass of wine)+ or to avoid drinking at all). never use alcohol to drown your sorrows particularly if money is one of your issues as it wont help in the longer term and can increase your problems. it also wont help if you get drunk (or even lose inhibitions at a lower level) and dwell on how bad your perfectly normal life is ~ or behave in a way you know youd regret on another day... there is a level at which alcohol can be useful ~ it is proven to reduce stress in small+ regular amounts+ but this is far below the recommended limits+ and these are far below what many people drink+ even if they dont consider themselves heavy drinkers. it is also one of the biggest societal problems causing debt+ relationship and health problems on a staggering scale.,0

i drink alcohol on an often basis and i have been suffering from psychosis for the last 2 years or so and am just wondering what are the side effects of drinking whilst you have psychosis?,"how drinking alcohol changes this feeling to maybe what would be a \normal state\"" if hadnt been in \""stressful\"" situations?""",repressed anger and stress are two different things in my opinion. repressed anger is ... one feels angry all the time inside but tries to keep it bottled up. the effect on ones heath can be devastating in both cases... stress if its not dealt with can cause physical problems. stress is worrying about a lot of things+ having too much work to do and too little time. an example would be a woman who is a wife and a mother and who has to go to work part time at least. she has to be a wife+ a lover+ a companion to her husband+ she has to be a mother and a carer and a friend to her children and she has to be a professional who does her job well+ shows compassion+ is friendly+ is efficient at work. all that is a big job and such a person needs some time to herself. she just needs to ask her husband to do some of the chores with her if she works as well. then he has to understand that its only fair after a hard day that if they do the chores together+ they also have more private time together and time to relax+ which she needs. also she needs some time at the weekends when she and her husband can just go out alone and somebody else will babysit the children if they are that young. she needs to get away from the stress and either her husband has to make her feel appreciated or she needs some alone time on occasion where she gets time to go out with her female friends+ for a coffee on a shopping spree+ laughing with other women+ doing a hobby+ reading a favourite book... she needs that time to herself to not get to a point where the stress builds up so much inside that it can cause high blood pressure+ anxiety+ it can lead to eating disorders such as comfort eating or not eating enough. it can lead to a heart attack if someone doesnt learn to use time management and just let some dirty laundry wait and do instead something that gives one a feeling of having fun. a human being is not a machine. people could become addicted to alcohol because they feel stressed+ thats true+ a mother who feels overwhelmed with everything or who has to be a model wife+ a super mom and then go to work+ if she cant find a way to manage stress and get help she might reach for the bottle and think that will help her and it never does+ it makes everything worse because its an addiction and it will come to a point when she cant hide it anymore. the dangerous thing about drinking is that in the early stages alcoholics manage to hide their drinking often and they deny it to themselves that they have a drinking problem. one day it will come to a point that they need a drink in the morning+ take some alcohol in a flask to work and may get drunk there and then they get found out. they then have to get help or otherwise they could lose their marriage+ their job and their children. people who smoke ...usually start out of curiosity and then they get hooked. probably not after one cigarette+ but some smoke because they are young and believe my friends all do it+ its so cool+ then they start it+ and after a little while they get addicted to the nicotine and become addicted and cant stop very easily+ if they suffer from stress and comfort eat (get overweight and smoke or drink+ then they are at a much higher risk of getting a serious health problem) they could suffer high blood pressure and high cholesterol and that could lead to a heart attack or a stroke especially if they are around age 40 or older. some people start to go to parties and they drink there+ then they drink also when they are alone. some people drink to drown some sorrows instead of going for help and seek help and talk to a friend or go to a councelor+ they drink instead+ they may suffer from insecurities and feel that drinking makes them lose inhibitions. they may drink because their friends all meet at the pub after work and so they become addicted to drinking whilst hanging out with friends... they may think its a social thing.. every weekend to hang out with friends and to drink large amounts of alcohol+ over the legal limit.. and they talk and think its fun+ but its bad for them really if they drink over the legal limit and hopefully they are at least smart enough to not drink and drive. especially those mothers who drink and have to pick up their kids from school or kindergarden+ might think they are not really drunk and can manage to drive+ but just one drink too many can make them a danger on the road to others and to themselves and the precious cargo they carry in their own car their child or childrenx,1
i drink alcohol on an often basis and i have been suffering from psychosis for the last 2 years or so and am just wondering what are the side effects of drinking whilst you have psychosis?,"how drinking alcohol changes this feeling to maybe what would be a \normal state\"" if hadnt been in \""stressful\"" situations?""",just try to think+ why does a man drink? he may be living a miserable life+ just to forget his sorrow he drinks. instead of stopping him from drinking+ we must do some positive efforts that shall help the misery+ pain+ sorrow+ unhappiness and problems of his life to be reduced or finished. if he is able to live a happy life again than why shall he drink? the basic quality of alcohol is it helps to forget. and thus by drinking we tend to forget our sorrow. but when we are happy    neither of us would like to drink and forget those joyful moments. when dealing with a person who has a drinking problem+ you should not hate him nor instruct him nor stop him. do not try to make him understand. you love him+ respect him+ and accept him the way he is. do not look at him with the eyes fill with hatred towards him. always do not raise you finger against him. might be+ if he gets your love and respect he would agree to give his life a new start in a new way. when we respect somebody then he too thinks that how shall he continue to be respectful? he will refrain him from doing those things that can bring down his respected image. when he will live with happiness in home+ receive love and affection<semcol> his pain and problems will be reduced+ his tensions will be lowered and than automatically he will stop drinking. this would be an indirect of making him to stop drink. if you directly say somebody that you must stop drinking+ he would not listen. that   s what people have been trying since many years and it did not brought any fruitful results.1,0

i am 3 months pregnant+ and my the father is an alcoholic drug addict?,in you opinion+ is this a alcoholic or drug addict?,this sounds exactly like alcohol+ if it was heroin then it wouldnt have those physical effects. (ive been both an alcoholic and a heroin addict so i know that im right to say that alcohol is the one which ruins your health and twists your mind). you say that she says she drinks because life is so awful+ i used to do the same. it took years for me to realise that life seemed awful because i drank+ rather than me drinking because life itself was at fault. long term drinking causes depression and therefore makes life seem awful+ drinking gives temporary relief but then the depression returns worse than before. as they say+ what goes up has to come down+ this is very true of alcohol. if she manages to stop drinking then after a while her depression will either be much less or disappear altogether+ making her happier and therefore feeling that she doesnt need to hide behind the drink. she would also become much more healthy+ something else which would cheer her up. alcohol is the cause of her depression+ its not curing it but is in fact creating it and making it worse. of course though its difficult to see this when youre in that situation. also+ the health warnings that we get about alcohol always emphasise the physical risks+ they never mention that its a strong depressant which can induce suicidal tendencies if abused in the long term. if it was heroin that she was on then she would be much more functional+ not only that but heroin use tends to make drinking alcohol feel repulsive and unneccesary. when i started on the heroin that was the end of my drinking. it might not be the normal thing to do but i deliberately started on it because i knew how it changed my feelings about alcohol+ nothing else was ever going to break through my alcoholism so i concluded it was better to be an alive junkie than a dead alcoholic. of course though getting off heroin was a battle too but now im free of addiction to either and lead a normal life. alls well that ends well i suppose. im not advocating that she does the same+ this is just how i approached the situation. it would also be a bad idea for her to get into that if she still has her ex addict boyfriend because hed soon end up back on it too.,0

why is cannabis illegal and alcohol not?,why does the government legalize tobacco and alcohol+ but keeps cannabis illegal?,"tobacco and alcohol being legal (but regulated) and marijuana being illegal is due more to legal/political issues than health reasons. the hemp industry was+ at one time+ in direct competition with both the cotton and timber industries. hemp was great for making clothing+ rope+ and paper+ and this was cutting into cottons and timbers profits. they put pressure on the government and+ using \christian values\"" they had laws passed against marijuana. as for the growth of tumors+ that is not substantiated. there are many different types of cancer+ each needing different treatment strategies. marijuana has been shown to help manage many chronic (no pun intended!) conditions. however+ medicinal marijuana is not the same as the stuff you get on the street. as for it causing death+ anything you smoke is bad for you. as for dieing from cannabinoid overdose+ that is not really probable. it causing cancer is linked back to the fact that you are inhaling smoke+ which damages the lungs. and yes it does contain carcinogens+ though not nearly as many as tobacco. smoking anything is bad for you+ and smoking weed does do brain damage. it doesnt stop just because you hit a magic age. ignoring the chemicals in weed which can damage brain tissue+ when you smoke anything enough+ it will reduce the oxygen in your blood+ which can lead to brain damage. brain cells naturally die off as you age+ but taking substances which damage brain cells makes it happen faster. i have known enough old pot heads to know that long term use does have some effect on cognitive function and memory. as for the damage from your tobacco use+ it is quite impossible to tell over the internet! as you were only a moderate smoker+ you should recover fully once your lungs have had a chance to heal. honestly+ alcohol is the most dangerous. people rarely smoke themselves to death+ but they drink themselves to death all the time! between cannabis and tobacco+ it is hard to say. natural tobacco is not nearly as bed+ pipe tobacco being next in line. oral tobaccos and cigarettes are by far the worst+ not because of the tobacco+ but because of the additives. comparing straight tobacco to weed+ tobacco would actually be better. however+ getting straight tobacco is not easy these days. another thing to take into account is that weed is slightly better as you dont smoke near as much of it as you do tobacco. underage drinking does cause deaths+ so you win the argument that cannabis is safer that booze! however+ the quality of the weed you get matters too. marijuana growers are working hard to \""improve\"" their crop. it is not the same+ safe plant from 40 years ago. buying it on the streets opens up the possibility of it being laced with other stuff. this is+ in fact+ the most dangerous aspect of marijuana use+ drug dealers. they introduce those who would otherwise have no interest in harder drugs to them during weed purchases. i have read the studies on marijuana being a gateway drug+ and it is complete bs!. by the definition of gateway drug: caffeine+ tv+ milk+ meat+ cars+ clothes+ water+ and virtually anything else you have or use can be a gateway drug. in the study+ people incarcerated for harder drug use were asked if they had used weed. depending on the study+ between 90-95% answered yes. however+ if you asked if they drank milk+ rode in a car+ or watched tv+ you would get a similar correlation. correlation doesnt mean causation. some studies indicate that +60% of all americans have tried marijuana+ but +60% of all americans are not hard drug addicts. by their logic+ going to sleep can lead to rape+ as im sure at least 90% of rapists have slept at some point. so should sleep and tv be outlawed?""",1

what is the appeal in drinking an excessive amount of alcohol!?,what are the risks of drinking alcohol at the young age of 14?,hi katie+ i have to be honest+ the first time i got wasted i was 14yrs old. problem was i really liked it+ so a few buddies & i would slowly sneak booze from our folks during the week & use it on the weekend. ill ask this of you: do you drink at age 14? are you curious about it? anyway+ alcohol is a cns (central nervous system) depressant. it slows your motor skills+ will begin to affect things like balance & speech+ & also affect your decision making by lowering your inhibitions. it also kills bumerous brain cells. as it continues to increase in your system your liver can no longer filter it as fast as youre taking it in. when you reach toxic levels (alcohol poisoning) it will cause you to vomit - your body is trying to get the poison out of your system. so when you see someone throw-up from drinking+ thats the first stages of alcohol poisoning. in the later stages you pass out as your nervous system is basically shutting down & could eventually cause your respiration to stop - death. if a 14 year old continues to drink regularly they will cause irreparable brain damage+ as well as serious and pre-mature damage to their liver+ heart+ kidneys+ & central nervous system. if you study the statistics youll also see the increased potential for behavioral problems that lead to legal problems. theres also a significant increase in pregnancy among teenagers that drink+ dropping out of school+ and sadly+ rape. statistics also reveal that a majority that continue to drink will use narcotics (illegal drugs). approximately 10% of the population has the pre-disposition for addiction. notice thats not 10% of drinkers ...that percentage is higher because many people abstain from drinking. im not bashing on you. in fact+ i applaud you for asking. i use to teach alcohol awareness courses to young people coming in the military. its a huge temptation & can honestly say there is a direct parallel between young people that drank with disciplinary problems+ marital problems+ spousal & child abuse+ & yes+ death (usually driving under the influence). a note from me: i understand the curiosity and the temptation to party as a social outlet. my only question to a young person is are you aware of the consequences of each decision because it will take a lot of maturity to not allow yourself to cross over some dangerous lines when alcohol begins to affect ones thinking. youre very wise & courageous to ask the question ...it means you want truth+ not emotionally loaded opinion. i hope my 10 year old daughter is just as wise to ask when she gets curious. good luck! -sgtofheart,0

what are the pros and cons or having a sip of alcohol (scotch) a day.,what are the pros and cons of having no alcohol? ,in moderation alcohol can be enjoyable and have no ill effects. however not everyone has self control or the foresight to stop drinking before they drink too much. alcohol can lead to drunk driving+ violence+ domestic abuse +stachatory rape+ and birth disorders. drunk driving can lead to collisions+ injuries and even fatalities. the injuries can be inflicted on innocent bystandards or by the sober passengers in the other vehicle involved in the crash. the sober victims of drunk driving may even be children+ or expectant mothers. it is not uncommon for alcohol to make drinkers angry or violent. the drinkers judgement is flawed and altered and they may overreact and act out in an aggressive way. (in a related story i had a friend who wanted to fight me when he was drunk because i didnt like asparagus.) they may want to fight strangers+ friends+ family+ and any one else at the smallest provocation. these can lead to domestic abuse and child abuse. when under aged drinkers become intoxicated at a house party they are at risk of stachatory rape. the whole scene is not a good set up. with no parents or chaperones and a whole house of intoxicated+ or not very well-intentioned people are grouped together the consequences are not good. rape victims who are drunk are easy targets because they may allow things they usually wouldnt+ they may pass out+ or they may black out the entire event the next morning. there are also birth disorders connected to alcohol abuse+ including fetal alcohol syndrome. the infant has no control over what the mother consumes+ and becomes a victim to a disorder that could easily been avoided with some consideration and self discipline. if alcohol were banned+ people would still find a way to find it illegally. making something illegal will not stop people who are determined to get it. then effort and time would go into catching people who are storing+ selling or drinking alcohol and they may be fined or otherwise legally punished even if they are not abusing alcohol. alcohol can be fun socially if used in moderation+ taking away the privilege to drink alcohol is not fair to those who know how to drink responsibly. i think a happy medium would be educating youth and others about the risks and dangers of alcohol and how to drink responsibly. they should make alcohol education more prevalent in schools+ just as they do sexual health.,1

(ive been both an alcoholic and a heroin addict so i know that im right to say that alcohol is the one which ruins your health and twists your mind). you say that she says she drinks because life is so awful+ i used to do the same. it took years for me to realise that life seemed awful because i drank+ rather than me drinking because life itself was at fault. long term drinking causes depression and therefore makes life seem awful+ drinking gives temporary relief but then the depression returns worse than before. as they say+ what goes up has to come down+ this is very true of alcohol. if she manages to stop drinking then after a while her depression will either be much less or disappear altogether+ making her happier and therefore feeling that she doesnt need to hide behind the drink. she would also become much more healthy+ something else which would cheer her up. alcohol is the cause of her depression+ its not curing it but is in fact creating it and making it worse. of course though its difficult to see this when youre in that situation. also+ the health warnings that we get about alcohol always emphasise the physical risks+ they never mention that its a strong depressant which can induce suicidal tendencies if abused in the long term. if it was heroin that she was on then she would be much more functional+ not only that but heroin use tends to make drinking alcohol feel repulsive and unneccesary. when i started on the heroin that was the end of my drinking. it might not be the normal thing to do but i deliberately started on it because i knew how it changed my feelings about alcohol+ nothing else was ever going to break through my alcoholism so i concluded it was better to be an alive junkie than a dead alcoholic. of course though getting off heroin was a battle too but now im free of addiction to either and lead a normal life. alls well that ends well i suppose. im not advocating that she does the same+ this is just how i approached the situation. it would also be a bad idea for her to get into that if she still has her ex addict boyfriend because hed soon end up back on it too.,1

treatment for jaundice caused by alcohol abuse ?,the most successful treatment program for alcohol abuse and drug abuse?,as an addiction counselor i avoid trying to say any one method is the best method. for us our motto is if something works+ then it works. doesnt matter what program or system it is. first and foremost+ the main thing is to go through detox. our rehab clinic wont even admit unless youve gotten through detox first. the main reason is that many addicts go through withdrawals and some times can turn violent and may hurt other clients or staff. after detox+ then a minimum 90 day in-treatment rehab is the best option. i can only speak for the place i work at+ but we do utilize a variation of the 12 step program. this is not meant to put the fear of god into people or push some christian agenda+ even though our facility is funded by a non-profit christian organization. the point of the 12 step program is to be used as a tool for one on one cbt (cognitive-behavioral therapy) and group therapy. as a tool it can be used as a step by step guide to set mile stones for clients and help them find the root of their addiction+ learn to forgive themselves+ how to get back in contact with close family and friends+ how to make a living outside of treatment and to make a support system as a part of relapse prevention+ which is the final phase of our recovery program. some do get sponsors (similar to those who are in aa). but we do not require that to complete our program. we do require that clients create a plan that outlines triggers for substance abuse+ a support system and what to do to prevent relapse as well as a goal oriented outline of what they wish to do with their lives. from here most clients then enter a half way house nearby. but i dont work there so i cannot speak for their system accept it involves more therapy and a stepping stone for recovering addicts to get a normal life back. i know they need to find work and they pay rent and they divide up the house work and try to teach people responsibility and discipline as well as further relapse prevention. as far as getting help outside of rehab+ most addicts are so resistant to therapy+ or really any kind of help that the only way to really get them to change is to take them away from their living space away from the people who enable them and put them into a controlled environment (rehab) and basically break them down. get them to put down their defenses and use our program to analyze their behavior+ why they use+ things they can do differently+ things they just need to accept and move on from and relapse prevention. again+ our system is build on a 90 day program. the half way house is usually between 6-12 months (if clients go that far+ most who do are court ordered to do so) and detox can be another month to 6 weeks+ depending on the addiction. some severe alcoholics or people addicted to opiates often need more time in detox. detox does also involve therapy. but its usually one on one and some group therapy if we feel they are not a danger to anyone. the point is that because of the pathology of addiction+ rehab tends to be more successful than just independent counseling. most addicts need a more intense+ 24-7 intervention. but if you do try to wing it on your own+ cbt or talk therapy is the most common+ as well as random drug testing (which we do in rehab as well) and aversion therapy. aversion therapy really only works for people who actually want to quit using substances - another reason why rehab is often the best answer since many addicts are court ordered into treatment or are their because basically their family forced them to go.,0
treatment for jaundice caused by alcohol abuse ?,the most successful treatment program for alcohol abuse and drug abuse?,!2 steps works decently enough however+ i believe it to be kindergarten for sobriety. if you want to rid your self of these needs then you must go to the root problem. many times its lack of self love+ gratitude+ and any presence of god in our lives. i know it sounds crazy but i dealt with a slew of addictions throughout my life both substance and behavioral. it wasnt until i discovered peace+ love of self and others+ and spirituality that i was able to truly detach from those urges. as wild as it may seem . . . what have you got to lose?20 years of addictive behavior to either or in concurrent combination of: cocaine+ alcohol+ relationships+ sex+ gaming+ etc.0,0

why did god make alcohol and marijuana if it causes problems?,cigars+ alcohol+ or marijuana+ which is the best and why?,niko is wrong. marijuana is easily the safest out of the three. cigars and alcohol are the worst. a cigar now and then is okay+ not a big deal+ just dont inhale. alcohol hurts the hell out of your liver+ and causes alcoholism+ and gets you to out of control. myth: today   s marijuana is more potent and more harmful than it was many years ago. fact: there is no medical evidence that shows high-potency marijuana is more harmful than low-potency marijuana. marijuana is literally one of the least toxic substances known. high-potency marijuana is actually preferable because less is of it consumed to obtain the desired effect<semcol> thereby reducing the amount of smoke that enters the lungs and lowering the risk of any respiratory health hazards. claiming that high-potency marijuana is more harmful than low-potency marijuana is like claiming wine is more harmful than beer. myth: smoking marijuana can cause cancer and serious lung damage. fact: there chance of contracting cancer from smoking marijuana is minuscule. tobacco smokers typically smoke 20+ cigarettes every day for decades+ but virtually nobody smokes marijuana in the quantity and frequency required to cause cancer. a 1997 ucla study (see page 9) concluded that even prolonged and heavy marijuana smoking causes no serious lung damage. cancer risks from common foods (meat+ salt+ dairy products) far exceed any cancer risk posed by smoking marijuana. respiratory health hazards and cancer risks can be totally eliminated by ingesting marijuana in baked foods. myth: marijuana contains over 400 chemicals+ thus proving that marijuana is dangerous. fact: coffee contains 1+500 chemicals. rat poison contains only 30 chemicals. many vegetables contain cancer-causing chemicals. there is no correlation between the number of chemicals a substance contains and its toxicity. prohibitionists often cite this misleading statistic to make marijuana appear dangerous. myth: marijuana is a gateway drug   it leads to harder drugs. fact: the u.s. government   s own statistics show that over 75 percent of all americans who use marijuana never use harder drugs. the gateway-drug theory is derived by using blatantly-flawed logic. using such blatantly-flawed logic+ alcohol should be considered the gateway drug because most cocaine and heroin addicts began their drug use with beer or wine   not marijuana. myth: marijuana is addicting. fact: marijuana is not physically addicting. medical studies rank marijuana as less habit forming than caffeine. the legal drugs of tobacco (nicotine) and alcohol can be as addicting as heroin or cocaine+ but marijuana is one of the least habit forming substances known. myth: marijuana use impairs learning ability. fact: a 1996 u.s. government study claims that heavy marijuana use may impair learning ability. the key words are heavy use and may. this claim is based on studying people who use marijuana daily   a sample that represents less than 1 percent of all marijuana users. this study concluded: 1) learning impairments cited were subtle+ minimal+ and may be temporary. in other words+ there is little evidence that such learning impairments even exist. 2) long-term memory was not affected by heavy marijuana use. 3) casual marijuana users showed no signs of impaired learning. 4) heavy alcohol use was cited as being more detrimental to the thought and learning process than heavy marijuana use. myth: marijuana is a significant cause of emergency room admissions. fact: the u.s. government reports that marijuana-related emergency room episodes are increasing. the government counts an emergency room admission as a marijuana-related episode if the word marijuana appears anywhere in the medical record. if a patient tests positive for marijuana because he/she used marijuana several days before the incident occurred+ if a drunk driver admits he/she also smoked some marijuana+ or if anyone involved in the incident merely possessed marijuana+ the government counts the emergency room admission as a    marijuana-related episode.    less than 0.2% of all emergency room admissions are    marijuana related.    this so-called marijuana-causes-emergencies statistic was carefully crafted by the government to make marijuana appear dangerous.,0

why did god make alcohol and marijuana if it causes problems?,why is alcohol legal but marijuana is not?,i think there are two factors: (1) you can easily test for alcohol inebriation in drivers on the road using a breathalyzer. no such reliable tests exist for thc+ and to prove that someone is driving under the influence of marijuana would require blood tests. developing a quick+ reliable roadside test is one of the last remaining barriers to marijuana legalization. (2) the pharmaceutical industry has a huge lobby (1+274 registered lobbyists in washington d.c and spent $2.6 billion on lobbying activities from 1998 through 2012 according to opensecrets.org)+ and they have a keen interest in keeping marijuana outlawed. if people started smoking or otherwise using marijuana products+ the people would stop purchasing their pills and medicines. additionally+ there is the reversal of a lot of myths+ lies+ and misinformation that has propagated about marijuana and thc in general. it is a slow and momentous task to change the way generations of people were taught+ and how they think. public opinion on marijuana legalization is moving overwhelmingly in favor of legalization though+ and has been one of the fastest shifts on an issue weve seen. 10 years ago around 30% of the country supported marijuana legalization+ today that is over 50%.,0

why people lose consciousness when they drink alcohol?,why does everyone like to drink alcohol?,most people drink it to relax ... it is an addictive depressant which gets into the bloodstream quickly and into every organ in the body. it is socially acceptable ... thats why people do it. they ignore what it is doing to their body and organs and what it does to those around them. i used to go out with my friends and drink one vodka and 7up then switch to just 7up which looked the same. so if you do go out with them you could just drink a clear pop and they would never know the difference. the bigger problem with drinking in a group is what they can put into your drink when you are not looking ... some of those can be deadly within seconds...,0

i am an alcoholic and my family hates me for it please help me.?,alcoholic mother+ please help!?,"your situation is awful. unfortunately youre paying the price for your mothers inability to get real help for her addition. i have some advice for you that might help+ but youll have to be very smart and patient because you might not get the answers you need/want right away. basically youll have to do some asking around in order to find the right person to help you with your unique situation. aa does help a lot of people+ but its not a \sure thing\"" for every addict. your mom experienced some sort of trauma in her life+ and this caused her to numb herself by using alcohol and drugs. life is difficult+ and certain people have poor coping skills. they turn to drugs to numb themselves from the emotional pain they experience in daily life. its a way of avoiding her personal history and all the things/people who have hurt and disappointed her during her life. please keep in mind that your moms negative experience with aa doesnt mean she isnt curable. aa is a twelve-step program+ but usually hardcore alcoholics and drug abusers need one-on-one psychological therapy with a really qualified psychologist or psychiatrist-- someone with a ph.d. in family therapy and addiction. i doubt the aa group leader she experienced was this qualified. also+ some people dont feel comfortable discussing all their problems in a group setting (its like baring all your nasty secrets to total strangers.) keep in mind that she has to want to change her life for herself and for her family-- otherwise therapy is really useless. aa is not the only program out there for alcohol and drug addiction. having said all this+ i want to suggest seeking some help in several places. you can explore all of them and make the decision (for yourself) what you think is the best option for your mother or yourself. 1. a social worker at a hospital might be able to help you. you could go to a local hospital emergency room+ and ask if you could speak with a social worker about your situation. they also might be able to help your mother get some free or low cost therapy and/or treatment programs that are not like aa. many psychologists can give your mother therapy on a \""sliding scale\"" where your payment is based on your mothers current income. if you make less money per year+ you pay less money for therapy. you can ask them about this too. 2. if you think therapy is the way to go+ you can see several psychologists in your town. tell them youre interested in learning about their services for family therapy and addiction. tell them youre 14 and dont have any money to give them+ but you really need advice about a serious family problem. tell them about your unique situation+ and ask for their help/advice. if they dont offer therapy on a \""sliding scale+\"" then ask them if they know of any high quality+ but low cost options for your mother and your family. 3. a guidance counselor at your school might be aware of options. you must (however) make sure that you expect them to keep your situation private+ and not to contact your mom until youve come up with a plan together. 4. the last option would be a crisis hotline. if you have exhausted your options+ or if your mom refuses to get help-- you have to come up with a plan to leave the house and live elsewhere. you might have the option of living with a grandparent+ aunt+ or uncle+ but this is unique for every family+ and may be complicated if you have any brothers and sisters involved. you sound like a wonderful+ smart person. youre really mature because youre forced to be in an adult situation. i want to tell you-- cutting yourself (like your moms addiction) wont numb the pain youre feeling. harming yourself is a way of showing on the outside how youre feeling inside. im sure you   re also hopeful that your mom will see how much pain shes causing you and she will stop behaving the way she does. in this sense+ you   re setting up yourself for disappointment because your mom   s behavior doesn   t change and you   re back into the cycle of harming yourself. hang in there+ sweetie-- youve come this far+ and help is available. in the meantime+ i strongly suggest that you read this book: toxic parents: overcoming their hurtful legacy and reclaiming your life by susan forward and craig buck http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?u    theres a chapter specifically on alcoholic parents and i think youll find it really revealing. you can buy it online+ or order it from a local library. see a librarian and they can help you find the book. i wish you the best of luck in the world. you can also seek help at a local church if you feel comfortable doing that. im sure someone there would help you (they might even agree to go with you to the psychologists offices+ and offer you some adult support.) hang in there-- things will get better. hugs.""",0

what are my chances of being an alcoholic?,what would you consider an alcoholic?,you can tell this obviously bothers you and it should! i have personally had to deal with alcoholics and i can tell you that it will only get worse before it gets better. so you have to ask yourself whether its worth it to deal with all of this. have you sat down with him and told him how it bothers you? has he agreed to maybe go get help from a doctor or attend an aa meeting? if he continues denying he has a problem and refuses to get help+ maybe its time you think about leaving him.1,0
what are my chances of being an alcoholic?,what are my chances of becoming an alcoholic?,when it comes to any addiction there are a lot of myths involved. addictions are genetic+ addictions are a personality trait. sure there may be some studies or genuine cases where this is the case but i think most addicts use this as an excuse to absolve themselves of any responsibility. the key thing to remember is that addictions are behavioural based and they creep up on you. they are not spontaneous. no one wakes up one day with a sudden addiction to cigarettes or drugs or alcohol or painkillers. it happens over time. at least you are aware of what could happen to you. thats the first step. so its okay to go out to parties and drink. do it every weekend if you want. but if you find that you cant have a good time without a drink. if you start drinking at home alone. if you need a drink to get through your day. then you will need to start changing your behaviours as an addiction might be occurring.,1
what are my chances of being an alcoholic?,what are my chances of becoming an alcoholic?,i mean pretty much anything in moderation is ok. alcoholism runs in my family as well+ and i do have an addictive personality. the best way to control it is just to make sure you dont start drinking habitually. im in college now and drink like a typical college student+ but i experienced some issues with tobacco. i hadnt ever taken a dip until the fall of my freshman year when i did it with a couple baseball teammates. it didnt start bad right away but then it got to a point where i was dipping 4 or 5 times a day without thinking about it. it took me noticing a receding gum to realize that i was sort of addicted and had to stop.1,1

why should alcohol be banned?,why should we drink alcohol?,"human beings have many basic needs including food+ shelter+ social interaction+ etc. but some could argue that humans (and other animals as well) have an innate desire to experience altered states of mind. psychoactive (mind altering) drugs have been a part of human culture for a long as civilization has. the most famous+ and perhaps the earliest popular psychoactive was alcohol. the effects of alcohol have been known for thousands of years. shaman in the amazon use ayahuasca+ a powerful hallucinogenic tea to communicate with the spirit world. native americans use psilocybin mushrooms and mescaline-containing peyote cacti as right of passage rituals. marijuana has been widely used and socially acceptable in india since ancient times+ and the opium yielding poppy has been hailed as a miracle plant. no other natural chemical on earth has been proven to be as effective at releiving pain as morphine has. and it is not just humans+ but animals in the rainforest often nibble more often at plants that get then high. in fact+ that is how tribesmen discovered these psychoactives in the first place. but in present day culture+ i think that we are addicted to euphoria. drinking alcohol is justified with+ \i like it because it tastes good+ not because of its effects\"". specifically+ the desirable effects of alcohol on the mind are the euphoria and relaxation brought on by a couple of drinks (or the sedation and numbness brought on by a few too many drinks). if people didnt like these feelings+ theyw ould not drink alcohol+ whether it tasted heavenly or burned your mouth. but almost everyone can universally agree that these effects are enjoyable. we enjoy having control over our state of mind+ and alcohol and drugs are a short cut to good feelings. this obviously becomes and issue when over used+ but moderate use of alcohol and responible use of drugs is not always a bad thing. if people had access to real+ factual information about drugs+ etc+ people wouldnt overdose or do dangerous drugs they are not ready for. but+ that is just my opinion. my point is+ people love euphoria (the feeling of well being+ and happiness brought on by most popular psychoactives) and use alcohol to acheive this. and make no mistake+ alcohol is as much a drug as heroin is.""",0

um why do people blow tons of money on drugs and alcohol?,why do so many people become dependent on drugs and alcohol?,there are many reasons. four i can think of are: 1) group behavior/ social norms - many people take drugs/alcohol and consume to much drugs/alcohol because they feel left out if everyone else is and they are not. no-one wants to feel left out. 2) inability to cope with life - when things get tough some people just dont have a sufficient coping mechanism. some people can cope with stress better than others. the others sometimes use drugs/alcohol to help them forget about their problems or experience a state were they are just not thinking about them anymore. 3) inheritance and learned behavior - addiction to certain types of drugs and to alcohol can actually be inherited from your parents. also+ if you grew up in a household where doing drugs/drinking alcohol is normal practice and encourage+ you will see it as normal behavior. 4) rebellion - some people+ particularly teenagers+ will simply do something because they are told not to. this could be as a way of rebelling from authority because (a) they want to establish their own identities or (b) their friends think its cool (again see 1). most people just really dont think about the consequences or think ahead+ think theyre immune or simply think that the advantages outweigh the consequences (whats a hangover or the possibility of becoming an addict if i can forger that my life sucks or brag about how pissed i was the night before to my friends?),1
um why do people blow tons of money on drugs and alcohol?,why do so many people become dependent on drugs and alcohol?,first off+ alcohol is a drug. dont separate them like alcohol is its own category. in many cases alcohol is more dangerous+ addictive+ and harmful than some of the illegal drugs. why do you prefer a certain food? why do you prefer a certain sport over another? just as these questions are a matter of personal preference and choice+ so is using drugs. some people use+ and some dont. they can be used to escape from problems+ or just to have fun. there is no one reason why people use drugs. some of the problems you stated are not from only drugs+ but the corrupt and misguided legal and societal systems in place today. does it make sense to jail people just for having a drug on them? would it not make more sense just to take the drug away and then fine them+ instead of costing the state thousands upon thousands of dollars to house users instead of focusing on murderers? is it not ludicrous that child molesters can and have gotten out of jail sooner than a drug dealer? rehabs are full because many people choose that over going to jail+ or their parents make them go. there would not be as many overdoses and deaths if people were fully educated upon the dangers of the drug+ and were able to get a pure drug from a store than wandering down in the ghetto. the whole war on drugs is a huge failure+ and always will be. using drugs is not morally wrong. committing crimes to get a fix or letting drugs rule your life is when using is morally wrong. responsible+ safe drug use should be allowed in our society+ because if we can drink a highly toxic+ yet legal drug+ and smoke a highly carcinogenic and cardiotoxic drug+ then we should be able to use any drug we please. it is our body+ not the governments. we should be free to do as we please with our own bodies+ regardless of the harm. why are we able to risk our lives for countless senseless purposes every day+ but cant simply snort+ smoke or inject whatever we feel like? as a whole+ society is quite naive and ignorant when it comes to drugs.1,0

why is alcohol legal but pot is not?,why is alcohol legal+ and not pot?,marijuana should be legal and it will eventually be legal. mexico and some countries in south america are already talking about legalization and they know that americas war on drugs has done nothing but hurt more people than it has helped them. uruguay just sent a bill to their congress on legalization of marijuana and if their congress passes it marijuana will be legalized there and manufactured throughout its country. this is only the beginning and i am sure more countries in south america will follow uruguay in legalization and it will spread throughout the americas and to europe and so on. portugal already has full legalization of all drugs. i say give america 10 to 20 more years and marijuana would be legalized or decriminalized to a point where every state will have medical marijuana which will practically be the legalization of marijuana. you will just need a medical card for marijuana which is very easy to get it seems in states such as california. keep fighting for what you believe in and dont let these brain washed people convince you other wise.,1

caffeine causes anxiety+ should i expect this with alcohol?,is caffeine a gateway to alcohol?,it is highly unlikely as caffeine is a stimulant that increases the activity of the central nervous system causing the person to become more alert+ wakeful etc. alcohol+ is a depressant that reduces the activity of central nervous system resulting in decreased arousal+ sedation+ and a sense of calmness/relaxation. since both drugs have the opposite effect it is unlikely that a person would go on to become addicted to alcohol because they consume caffeine.,1

caffeine causes anxiety+ should i expect this with alcohol?,anxiety depression and alcohol?,i tried zoloft and had to stop because of weird side effects. it helped me a little with depression but nothing for anxiety. might have been the side-effects causing some of the anxiety+ i dont know. i havent had a drink in a long time because i gave it up as a means of self-medication. the problem with alcohol is that there is a fine line between medicinal use and plain abuse. its hard to find that sweet spot when the drug (yes alcohol is a drug) is affecting your judgement. on top of that you build a tolerance to it and it becomes even harder to get the amount right. then in 20 years you have a whole different reason for anxiety because alcohol is so hard on your body when over consumed. my advice to you is be careful with the alcohol and definitely dont use it with pharmaceuticals unless the doctor explains the possible interactions. i live in a medical marijuana state and have had a card for 4 years. i started using it for permanent back pain but i found that it kills my anxiety and depression and now thats what i use it for. it did a great job on the back pain too. i would recommend trying it+ if you have access+ with the following caution: it has different effects for different people so it may not be for you. some people report that it causes anxiety but you might consider seeing if it has the same anti-anxiety/depression effect that it has for me and a lot of other people. compared to alcohol its very non-toxic and doesnt interact with many pharmaceuticals. just a thought.,0

why do people drink alcohol or/and smoke when they know that they can get cancer or heart problems from it?,"why do people drink alcohol +++if it is a \depressant and makes you depressed?""",alcohol depresses your central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) which is why it is called a depressant. this is totally physiological (physical not mental). it can also depress your mood over time (with continued+ daily use)+ which is why it is also considered a depressant in psychological (mental) terms. so during one nights worth of drinking+ as the alcohol reaches different parts of your brain+ different pathways are inhibited/depressed. the depression of some of the pathways in your cerebral cortex cause a euphoric effect and can depress the firing of neurons that cause anxiety. here is how alcohol spreads through the brain. (bac = blood alcohol content) bac = 0.1 --> cerebral cortex (outer layer of brain) = relaxation/euphoria<semcol> neurons that cause anxiety are depressed. bac = 0.2 --> forebrain (prefrontal cortex) = loss of inhibitions/judgment/behavior. neurons associated with judgement are depressed. bac = 0.3 --> cerebellum = balance/equilibrium/motor skills<semcol> neurons that control balance/walking are depressed. bac = 0.4 to 0.5 --> brain stem = alcohol poisoning/ unconsciousness/death. neurons that control heart beat & breathing are depressed. long term (daily) alcohol abuse causes tolerance (you require more and more to reach same effect)+ dependency (your body doesnt feel right without it)+ and addiction (you are mentally addicted to the euphoric feeling it gives you). alcoholics are often mentally depressed and hate the fact that they drink+ but they cant stop because of their physical dependency and mental addiction.,0
